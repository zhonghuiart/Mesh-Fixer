A Blender add-on designed to **optimize the modeling and export workflow**.  
It automates tedious and repetitive cleaning and checking tasks such as applying modifiers, transforms, fixing normals, and organizing material IDs — saving time and reducing errors in production.

## 🔧 Features

Open the right-hand toolbar in the 3D Viewport by pressing `N`. Navigate to the **Batch-Cleanup** tab to access all functions:

### ✅ 1. Apply Modifiers (Single or Batch)

<img src="https://github.com/zhonghuiart/Batch-Cleanup/blob/22f34a586610e74a14a96dee5ffaa62a62a5e41c/images/modifiers.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Automatically apply all modifiers to selected objects or the entire scene, then merge by distance to clean up extra vertices.

- `To Selected` — Apply all modifiers to selected objects  
- `To All` — Apply all modifiers to all objects in the scene  

Useful for converting procedural models into editable geometry quickly.

---

### ✅ 2. Apply Transforms (Single or Batch)

<img src="https://github.com/zhonghuiart/Batch-Cleanup/blob/0945413ac81dc54e17ba4c872fe8645f4bb7cf18/images/transform.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Fix issues caused by unapplied transformations, such as incorrect bevels, solidify thickness, or array scaling.

- Automatically applies **location, rotation, and scale**
- Resets origin point to geometry center

- `To Selected` — Apply transforms to selected objects  
- `To All` — Apply transforms to all objects  

Ideal for ensuring export compatibility with Substance painter and UE, avoiding flipped normals or hidden faces.

---

### ✅ 3. Check and Fix Face Orientation

<img src="https://github.com/zhonghuiart/Batch-Cleanup/blob/0945413ac81dc54e17ba4c872fe8645f4bb7cf18/images/normals.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Incorrect face normals can cause disappearing or broken geometry in Substance Painter or Unreal Engine.  
This tool allows you to:

- Toggle face orientation display  
- Recalculate normals outside (`Shift + N` equivalent)  
- Flip normals for flat planes if needed

- `👁️` — Toggle face orientation visibility
- `Flip` — Flip normals for selected objects
- `To All` — Recalculate normals for all objects  

---

### ✅ 4. Batch Assign and Rename Materials

<img src="https://github.com/zhonghuiart/Batch-Cleanup/blob/0945413ac81dc54e17ba4c872fe8645f4bb7cf18/images/material.png?raw=true" width="1000">

Maintain clean material IDs when exporting to Substance Painter or UE, avoiding messy material settings. 
The material ID function can be toggled on or off — enable it only when you want to generate or rename materials.

- Automatically assigns a new material to each object using its name + suffix
- Existing materials will be suffixed with `_1`, `_2`, etc.

- `checkbox` — Enable to auto-assign material IDs. Disable to skip. (default: `disable`)
- `Suffix` — Customize material suffix (default: `shader`)
- `To All` — Assign material IDs to all objects  

Example: An object named `Chair` will receive a material named `Chair_shader_1`.

---

### ✅ 5. One-Click Full Workflow Execution

<img src="https://github.com/zhonghuiart/Batch-Cleanup/blob/0945413ac81dc54e17ba4c872fe8645f4bb7cf18/images/runall.png?raw=true" width="1000">

This button runs **all the above steps** in the proper order:

- Apply modifiers
  
- Apply transforms
  
- Recalculate normals
  
- Assign materials  

Click `Run` once your models are finalized to prepare the entire scene for export — fast and clean.
